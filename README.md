# 📁 `push_swap`

A sorting algorithm visualizer and optimizer. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using the fewest possible operations from a limited instruction set.

## Features
- Sorting of integers using a restricted command set: `sa`, `sb`, `ra`, `rra`, `pb`, `pa`, etc.
- Optimization of move sequences
- Custom stack implementation

## Usage
```bash
make
./push_swap 3 2 1
```

## Goal
To gain experience with algorithm optimization, stack operations, and sorting theory.
